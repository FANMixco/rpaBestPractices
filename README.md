# ðŸ¤– RPA Best Practices

This website is searching to collect all **Best Practices** to develop **RPAs** (Robotic Process Automations). I have already these categories on my list:

- Basics
- Requirements Gathering
- Logs
- Infrastructure
- Desktop Apps
- RPA Platforms
- Websites
- VBA Macros
- Authentification
- Volume
- Documents processing
- Notifications
- ERP
- Citrix/Virtual Machines

Maybe you have another one! Or something platform specific for Automation Anywhere or UiPath! Feel free to share it.
